# networks

This repository contains the networks as required by the NNUE evaluation in Stockfish.

## general

The networks follow the naming convention
```
nn-SHA.bin
```
where SHA are the first 12 digits of the sha256sum of the nn.bin data file (`sha256sum nn.bin | cut -c1-12`).

For a given Stockfish version, the default network name (UCI option `EvalFile`),
specifies the compatible and tested network file name. Other combinations may or may not work.

## contributors

Networks that have been successfully tested on fishtest can be added to this repository by pull request.
Such a pull request will be part of a twin PR to the official-stockfish/Stockfish repository that
changes the default value of EvalFile to match the network name.

As a form of documentation, for the benefit of other developers,
the commit message of the pull request should specify basic information
on how the net has been created. Please update the AUTHORS file.
